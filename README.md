# **Daksh's Portfolio**

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 🎉 This project showcases my skills and passion for **web development** and **3D animations**. Built with **React.js** and enhanced with **Three.js** for stunning 3D visuals, this portfolio reflects my journey as a developer.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This portfolio is not just a showcase of my work but a way to demonstrate my expertise in building **dynamic** and **responsive** web applications. I designed and developed it from scratch, integrating engaging **3D animations** that bring a modern, interactive feel to the experience.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **React.js** – The core framework used for building the user interface.
- **Three.js** – For rendering amazing 3D animations and interactive graphics.
- **TailwindCSS** – For styling, making the portfolio responsive across multiple screen sizes.
- **JavaScript** – The language that powers all dynamic interactions and animations.
  
## 💡 **Features:**

- **Interactive 3D Animations**: Thanks to Three.js, the portfolio features engaging animations that bring the site to life.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts seamlessly across devices (optimized for desktop for now).
- **Showcase of Work**: The portfolio highlights my skills and past projects in the **About**, **Work**, and **Contact** sections.
- **Sleek User Interface**: Clean, modern design, focusing on user experience.

## 🌐 **Live Demo**

For the best experience, please view the portfolio on **desktop**. Mobile devices might not render the 3D animations and layout properly at the moment, but I’m working on improving it. 👨‍💻
